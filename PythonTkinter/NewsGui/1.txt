This is first news Let's start our simple sketchpad example. For now, we'll implement freehand drawing on the canvas with the mouse. We create a canvas widget and attach event bindings to it to capture mouse clicks and drags. When the mouse is first pressed, we'll remember that location as the "start" of our next line. As the mouse is moved with the mouse button held down, we create a line item from this "start" position to the current mouse location. This current location becomes the "start" position for the next line item. Every mouse drag creates a new line item.
